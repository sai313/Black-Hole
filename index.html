                <p id="aboutbh">A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it. Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. ... After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971. Astronomers have discovered a small black hole outside the Milky Way by looking at how it influences the motion of a star in its close vicinity.<br><br>Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known as such was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.</p>
